Following a hiatus from work due to a pregnancy and the covid pandemic, the client is recommencing business, but has moved from rented retail premises to premises adjoining her dwelling house.

1.  [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) Tutorials were used to help in the coding of the dropdown navigation bar, the parallax scrolling effect and the insertion of the location map using Google Maps API.

2. The creation and styling of the Polaroid image was adapted from a tutorial by [Savv Studio](https://medium.com/@SavvStudio/tutorial-make-your-images-look-like-polaroid-pictures-with-html-and-css-7b1120732dd1). 

3. I viewed numerous tutorials on Youtube for help with the box model, display properties and the flex-box model. Specifically, tutorials by [Web Dev Simplfied](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw), [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) and [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) helped further my understanding of positioning.
