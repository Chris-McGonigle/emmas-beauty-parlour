# Emma's Beauty Parlour

Emma's Beauty Parlour is a sole trader beautician business based in Tempo, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.

Following a pregnancy and the covid pandemic, the client has moved from rented retail premises to premises adjoining her dwelling house.

Until now the client had been using social media channels and word of mouth to drive business leads, but during the pandemic she seen how useful a website would've also been to the business and now wants to get one set up.

The basic functions that the client wants the website to feature are:
* a list of the services provided (including pricing structure and any relevant Health & Safety Information)
* the new business location details
* a contact/enquiry form

The website is aimed at a female audience, who make up 95% of the clients custom.
